# Car Features vs Car Price
This project objective is to analyze car specifications and how that would affect the price of the car. After visualizing the data, it has been discovered that the production has a major factor where new cars are worth more than old ones excluding rare vintage cars where the older the more expensive. Other information has been discovered such as electric car transmissions, luxury cars and relationship between horsepower & engine size. The dataset being used was made through personal research through brand name websites and extracting the latest information from the car manufacturers directly. Key note is to have pandas and openpyxl installed on your computer before executing, this is stated inside the module already. As the author of this project, I am intrigued by cars and in the process of learning about the mechanics and special features of vehicles to prepare for future car projects. By demonstrating a machine learning version of cars, the analysis made will provide insightful information regarding the creation of these vehicles.
